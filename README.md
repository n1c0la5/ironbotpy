# ironbotpy
Control the Ironbot from python

Current project is on linux only as it uses hcitool and gatttool, once that's working the plan is to switch pybluez/lihtblue and make it work on Windows/Mac also (at least in principle as I won't be able to test on those).

Many thanks to Tom @ RoboSpace/Xiamen JornCo Information Technology Co., Ltd for providing the basic bluetooth protocoll information. For more information check out www.robospace.cc
